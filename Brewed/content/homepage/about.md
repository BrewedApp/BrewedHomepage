In 2021 I had the idea, how cool it would be sharing my few decent tasting coffee preparations with my fellow coffee nerd friends. Fast forward and two university exam phases later, I finished coding a base backend service and started getting into app development with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).   
After some time of coding and lots of telling people what I want to achieve with the app I decided to go for it and invest a whole lot of time to develop the app.
